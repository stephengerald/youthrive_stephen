                <h1>About Us</h1>
                <p>
                    LaborX is an on-demand work platform built by Australian blockchain company Chrono.tech. <br> As a jobs marketplace hosted on the
                    Ethereum network, LaborX connects freelancers and customers <br> through smart contracts, enabling robust protections and efficient
                    blockchain payments â€“ <br> wherever the different parties are based.
                </p>
                <h1>Mission</h1>
                <p>
                    The purpose of LaborX is to facilitate the creation of a truly global, freelance jobs market, that will power the growth of the gig <br>
                    economy and drive mass cryptocurrency adoption.
                </p>
                <p>
                    LaborX achieves this by removing the barriers inherent in conventional freelance work platforms. Digital work contracts formalise the <br>
                    agreement between customer and freelancer, with escrowed payments and automatic settlement in cryptocurrency once key milestones are <br>
                    completed. Intuitive search and a decentralised scoring system enable users to work together with confidence, and a dispute resolution <br>
                    mechanism ensures fast and cost-effective arbitration of disputes if necessary.
                </p>
